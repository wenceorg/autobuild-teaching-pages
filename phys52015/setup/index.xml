This will either be Hamilton, or (for some Physics students) COSMA. You don&amp;rsquo;t automatically get an account on Hamilton, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to register for one.
Access to Hamilton # For many of the exercises in the course, we will be using the Hamilton supercomputer. You should obtain an account on Hamilton by following their instructions.</description></item><item><title>Local setup</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/setup/byod/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/setup/byod/</guid><description>Running the exercises on your own hardware # Although you don&amp;rsquo;t need to, you might find it useful or convenient to run the exercises on your own computer. To do so, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to obtain appropriate compilers and MPI implementations.
For more general information on getting a development toolchain setup, the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Imperial College have prepared some useful guides

I therefore recommend that you set up an ssh config file.
Additionally, you might also want to set up ssh keys for passwordless login.
The ssh-config configuration file # Mac/Linux When you run ssh it reads a configuration file at $HOME/.</description></item><item><title>Unix resources</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/setup/unix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/setup/unix/</guid><description>Using Unix-like systems for computational science # This course presupposes some level of familiarity with commandline interfaces. In case you need a quick refresher, I recommend the material produced by the Software Carpentry project.
They have a number of useful lessons and materials providing introductory training on how to do things like use the Unix shell, version control with git, and some introductory programming and plotting in Python. They are good place to start for a gentle introduction to these topics.</description></item></channel></rss>

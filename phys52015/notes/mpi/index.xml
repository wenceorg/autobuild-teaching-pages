In MPI, communication via messages is two-sided1. That is, for every message one process sends, there must be a matching receive call by another process.
Cartoon of sending a message between two processes
We need to fill in some details
How will we describe &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; How will we identify processes How will the receiver know which message to put where?</description></item><item><title>Non-blocking point-to-point messaging</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/notes/mpi/point-to-point-nb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/phys52015/notes/mpi/point-to-point-nb/</guid><description>Non-blocking messages # Rationale.

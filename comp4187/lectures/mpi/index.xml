In MPI, communication via messages is two-sided1. That is, for every message one process sends, there must be a matching receive call by another process.
Cartoon of sending a message between two processes
We need to fill in some details
How will we describe &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; How will we identify processes How will the receiver know which message to put where?</description></item><item><title>Non-blocking point-to-point messaging</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/point-to-point-nb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/point-to-point-nb/</guid><description>Non-blocking messages # As well as the blocking point to point messaging we saw last time, MPI also offers non-blocking versions.
These functions all return immediately, and provide a &amp;ldquo;request&amp;rdquo; object that we can then either wait for completion with or inspect to check if the message has been sent/received.
The function signatures for MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv are:
int MPI_Isend(const void *buffer, int count, MPI_Datatype dtype, int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request); int MPI_Irecv(void *buffer, int count, MPI_Datatype dtype, int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request); The mpi4py versions are:</description></item><item><title>Collectives</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/collectives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/collectives/</guid><description>Collective communication # Point-to-point messages are sufficient to write all the parallel algorithms we might want. However, they might not necessarily be the most efficient.
As motivation, let&amp;rsquo;s think about the time we would expect the [ring reduction]({{ ref &amp;ldquo;mpi-ring.md&amp;rdquo; }}) you implemented to take as a function of the number of processes.
Recall from the [ping-pong exercise]({{ ref &amp;ldquo;mpi-ping-pong.md&amp;rdquo; }}) that our model for the length of time it takes to send a message with $B$ bytes is</description></item><item><title>Advanced topics</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/advanced/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/mpi/advanced/</guid><description>Some pointers to more advanced features of MPI # Communicator manipulation # We saw that we can distinguish point-to-point messages by providing different tags, but that there was no such facility for collective operations. Moreover, a collective operation (by definition) involves all the processes in a communicator.
This raises two questions:
How can we have multiple collective operations without them interfering with each other; What if we want a collective operation, but using only a subset of the processes (e.</description></item></channel></rss>

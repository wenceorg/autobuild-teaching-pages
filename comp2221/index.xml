Initially, we&amp;rsquo;ll start off using the interpreter. It can be invoked with ghci, so at a terminal prompt run
$ ghci When I show commands in the terminal, I will use a $ to indicate the prompt (which you should not type), followed by the command to type.</description></item><item><title>Types and lists</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp2221/exercises/exercise2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp2221/exercises/exercise2/</guid><description>Thinking about types # You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed by now that GHC will complain if you write some code where the types don&amp;rsquo;t match. To do this, it uses type inference to determine the valid types of any functions you write, and checks that everything works. For example, suppose I have a function
allTrue :: [Bool] -&amp;gt; Bool allTrue [] = True allTrue (x:xs) = x &amp;amp;&amp;amp; allTrue xs which checks if every entry of a list of Bools is True.</description></item></channel></rss>

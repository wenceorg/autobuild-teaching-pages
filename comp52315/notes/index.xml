All modern general purpose hardware uses a von Neumann architecture. That is, there is a memory which stores both the program code to be executed and the data for the program. This is attached to a processor (CPU) which contains execution units for executing individual instructions in the program code along with further parts of logical control and load/store of data.</description></item></channel></rss>
